        <h3>"Who are you?"</h3>
        <code>Well, nothing special, just an eighteen year old person interested in computers and art.

            I'm not a professional in any way whatsoever, I do things to have fun and cause its interesting.</code>
        <h3>"Where are you from? Where do you belong?"</h3>
        <code>Guess it.</code>
        <h3>"What are you doing right now?"</h3>
        <pre>
        <code>
I'm learning and playing around with a few languages, see pinned 
repositories on my github for an idea of what I'm upto.

The languages currently are:
            
-   Python
-   C#
-   Go
            
Maybe I'll play with a bit of PHP
            
I wanna write software to entertain myself and help people.
Tho I don't think I achived the latter goal till now.

      <h3>"Cool, what more interests you?"</h3>
      <code>My interests are quite, weird. They're scattered all over the place.
        I've been fascinated by music and have studied it since the age of 6, I've performed on stage and on air but yeah now I've been away from that. I specialize in key instruments.
        Another thing that interests me is Media Production, aka, working with audio, video and broadcasting media.</code>
